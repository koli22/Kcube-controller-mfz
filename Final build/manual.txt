USER MANUAL – Thorlabs Sisenik Controller
=========================================

1. GETTING STARTED
------------------

- Before using this application, connect each K-Cube to the computer **and open the official Thorlabs Kinesis app** once to allow the system to recognize the device and assign its type. Then close the Thorlabs app and continue with this application.
- Connect all K-Cubes to your computer via USB.
- Launch the application.
- If devices do not appear automatically, press the "Refresh" button.

⚠️ **Important:** Do not disconnect any cubes while the application is running.  
If a cube is unplugged during use, **you must close the application, reconnect the cube, and restart the app** to ensure proper initialization.

The app will scan for connected devices and list them in a scrollable window.

2. INITIAL SETUP
----------------

**Assigning Names to Cubes**
- Assign a custom name to each cube (e.g., “Pump λ/2”).
- Use the scrollable list to select or add a new name.

**Initializing Devices**
- Once all cubes are named, press the "INIT" button.
- Initialization will run in the background (multi-threaded).
- After initialization, the main control window opens.

3. MAIN WINDOW FUNCTIONS
------------------------

- MANUAL: Open this user manual.
- SETTINGS: Reopen the device naming window.
- CALIBRATE: Open calibration window to align optical components.
- MEASURE: Open the measurement setup window.
- QUIT: Save settings and safely close the application.

4. CALIBRATION WINDOW
---------------------

- Use this window to align and reset positions of all cubes.
- Adjust each cube manually as needed.
- Only one calibration window can be opened at a time.

- The application will calculate angles based on element type.

**Running a Measurement**
- Set desired components and base angles for both lines.
- Press "Run" to rotate all selected cubes.
- The interface will remain responsive while motors are moving.

6. SAVING & LOADING CONFIGURATIONS
